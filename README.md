**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

Output Adjustment

No manual post-model output adjustment was applied to the selected models. The raw predictions from Random Forest, SVM (OVR), and Logistic Regression were directly adopted as the final outputs since they already demonstrated strong discriminatory power, balanced performance across classes, and stability across validation samples.

However, to maintain transparency and alignment with model risk governance, sensitivity analyses were conducted to test if manual alignment (e.g., Probability of Default [PDO] scaling or re-calibration) would meaningfully improve calibration. Results confirmed that the synthetic dataset’s controlled structure and the ensemble’s near-perfect classification ability (Accuracy: 0.998–1.000, Precision/Recall: 0.983–1.000) did not warrant further adjustments.

This approach ensures that the model outputs remain reproducible, logically consistent, and free from subjective overrides. Should future deployment with real production datasets reveal deviations (e.g., class imbalance or calibration drift), output adjustment methods such as Platt scaling, isotonic regression, or score alignment could be considered.


4.6.4 Alignment for Regulatory Reporting

The current model development was conducted exclusively on synthetic datasets for proof-of-concept purposes, and is not directly intended for regulatory submissions (e.g., Basel, CCAR, IFRS-9, or CECL). Nevertheless, alignment principles were reviewed to demonstrate readiness for future regulatory adaptation:

Alignment Purpose

In regulatory contexts, score outputs often need to be calibrated to align with Probability of Default (PD) or Expected Credit Loss (ECL) requirements.

This involves mapping model scores to long-run default rates or applying segment-wise scaling.

Alignment Methodology (if applied in future)

Establish a baseline PD term structure based on historical default data.

Apply scaling factors or logistic transformations to raw model scores to ensure monotonicity and stability.

Validate alignment using back-testing against hold-out datasets or regulatory reference portfolios.

Model Risk Management (MRM) Governance

Any alignment procedure must remain transparent, documented, and repeatable.

MIS reports (e.g., calibration plots, score distributions, alignment tables) should be attached for MRM validator review.

Alignment approvals are subject to governance checkpoints before regulatory use.

Given the synthetic nature of this proof-of-concept, no formal regulatory alignment was executed. However, the methodology described above provides a framework for seamless transition to compliance-driven environments if extended to real production datasets.
