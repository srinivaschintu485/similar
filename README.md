**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySparkâ€™s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

Subject: Urgent: Request for Resolution on Helix Access/Login Failure (INC0013547770)

Hi Team,

I have been facing this Helix access/login issue since September 16th, 2025, and despite multiple attempts it is still unresolved. The incident INC0013547770 was raised on the same date, and since then I have followed up on September 16th, 24th, and 29th through tickets, emails, and chats, but the issue continues. The case has also been reassigned across multiple support groups, yet no resolution has been provided.

This access is experimental and time-bounded, which makes the resolution extremely critical. Every day lost further reduces the available time to test and validate, and I am unable to proceed with my work. Given the importance of this setup and the limited window we have, I request that this be treated with the highest level of urgency and resolved at the earliest.

From my side, I have already tried the suggested troubleshooting steps (including proxy variable checks), but the login error still persists. Please escalate this further and assign it to the appropriate team to avoid any further delays.

Thanks for your support and prompt action on this.

Regards,
Srinivas Pendotagaya
