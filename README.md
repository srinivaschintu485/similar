**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark‚Äôs robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

Step 1: Request Access to Gen AI Experiment Use Case

Use case title
AI-powered log analytics and anomaly detection

Use Case Objective
Modern enterprise systems generate terabytes of logs across applications, infrastructure, and security platforms. Manually analyzing these logs to detect anomalies, performance bottlenecks, or security events is time-consuming and error-prone.

The objective of this use case is to leverage GenAI capabilities to build an intelligent log analysis assistant that can:

Parse and summarize large volumes of application, infrastructure, and security logs.

Identify anomalies and patterns (e.g., unusual spikes in errors, failed jobs, unauthorized access attempts).

Provide natural-language explanations of the detected issues.

Suggest possible remediation steps based on historical incidents and system knowledge.

This accelerates root-cause analysis, improves system reliability, and helps teams proactively address issues before they escalate.

Perfect üëç ‚Äî here are **10 GenAI use cases tailored for the Citi / financial sector** that could be highly useful and practical for requesting experiment access. I‚Äôve grouped them by **business domain** so you can pick depending on whether you want TechOps, Risk, Compliance, or Customer-facing experiments.

## üîπ **10 GenAI Use Cases in Citi Sector**

### 1. **AI-powered Regulatory Document Summarization**

* Automatically summarize lengthy regulatory circulars (e.g., FED/SEC/FINRA updates).
* Extract key obligations and action points for compliance teams.
* Saves time for compliance officers and reduces missed regulatory requirements.

---

### 2. **GenAI-driven Risk Report Analysis**

* Parse and summarize quarterly risk & control reports.
* Highlight anomalies, overdue items, and priority risks.
* Provide natural language insights to senior stakeholders.

---

### 3. **AI-assisted KYC (Know Your Customer) Review**

* Use GenAI to analyze KYC documents and transaction histories.
* Flag inconsistencies, missing information, or high-risk patterns.
* Help analysts focus on escalations instead of routine checks.

---

### 4. **Automated Incident Ticket Triage (TechOps/Infra)**

* Analyze ServiceNow/JIRA incidents using GenAI.
* Suggest routing to correct teams, extract root cause patterns, and propose resolution steps.
* Reduces Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).

---

### 5. **AI-powered Fraud Detection Explanation**

* Fraud engines raise alerts but are often ‚Äúblack-box.‚Äù
* Use GenAI to explain in plain English why a transaction was flagged as suspicious (e.g., unusual merchant, time, location).
* Helps investigators prioritize real fraud vs false positives.

---

### 6. **AI-driven Test Case Generation for Finance Apps**

* Generate unit/integration test cases for complex Citi apps (trading, payments, compliance systems).
* Ensure coverage of edge cases like leap years, settlement delays, or high-volume spikes.
* Cuts manual QA effort.

---

### 7. **AI-enhanced Policy & Procedure Q\&A Assistant**

* Employees can query GenAI with ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the approval process for X?‚Äù
* AI fetches and answers from internal policy documents.
* Reduces dependency on manual reading of long PDF policies.

---

### 8. **AI-powered AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Pattern Summarizer**

* Given transaction data, GenAI summarizes suspicious movement of funds across accounts.
* Generates investigator-ready narratives for AML case files.
* Reduces manual summarization time by analysts.

---

### 9. **Financial Data Validation & Reconciliation**

* Automate comparison of large reconciliations (e.g., between internal books vs clearing houses).
* Use GenAI to explain mismatches in plain text.
* Speeds up EOD (End of Day) financial reporting.

---

### 10. **Client Communication Drafting (Regulatory & Markets)**

* GenAI helps relationship managers draft tailored client updates.
* Example: Summarize Fed rate changes ‚Üí draft a client-friendly update on impact to bond portfolio.
* Ensures consistent, compliant communication.

---

‚úÖ These use cases are **safe for pilots** (no direct customer-facing deployment yet), but **high-value for Citi** in Ops, Risk, Compliance, Tech, and Client coverage.
