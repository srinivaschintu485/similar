**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

Got it—this section is really about pre-processing (data preparation + feature engineering) before modeling. Here’s a concise, paste-ready write-up aligned to the code you shared.

3.3.2 Data Pre-processing (Quality Checks & Transformations)

Objective. Convert paired source vs target fields into numeric, model-ready features without dropping rows or imputing values. All steps are deterministic and reproducible in PySpark.

A. Ingestion & Basic Validation
	•	Schema checks. Verify presence of raw comparison columns and all engineered fields required downstream.
	•	Type enforcement. Cast every modeled column to float (withColumn(...cast("float"))); assembler builds features via VectorAssembler.
	•	Row reconciliation. Record counts are unchanged from ingestion → feature build → assembler (no filtering).
	•	Label integrity. Spot-checks ensure labels match patterns (e.g., Leading Zero, Thousand Separator).

B. Feature Engineering (per record)

All features are computed from the raw source/target strings and then cast to numeric.
	•	Perfect_match – 1 if strings identical (post standardization), else 0.
	•	Similarity_Percentage – normalized string-similarity score (0–1) using token/character distance.
	•	numeric_check – 1 if both values parse as numbers, else 0.
	•	source_len, destination_len – character counts of each side.
	•	Scientific_Notation – 1 if either value is in scientific form (e.g., 1.2E+05).
	•	Thousand_Separator – 1 if the only difference is grouping marks (1,234 vs 1234/1 234).
	•	Rounded_Off – 1 if numbers differ only by rounding to typical precision.
	•	Leading_Zero – 1 if mismatch is due solely to zero padding (00123 vs 123).
	•	Currency_Diff – 1 when currency symbols/codes or scaling (¢ vs $) cause the discrepancy.
	•	Negative_Check – 1 for sign mismatches (-123 vs 123).
	•	Case_Sensitive_Score – proportion of exact case matches across tokens (0–1).
	•	Case_Insensitive_Score – similarity ignoring case (0–1).
	•	Case_Sensitivity_Diff – Case_Insensitive_Score − Case_Sensitive_Score (isolates pure case issues).
	•	Special_Character_Score – proportion of matching alphanumerics after stripping punctuation.
	•	Special_Character_Diff – penalty capturing differences due to punctuation/symbols only.
	•	Space_diff – normalized difference caused only by whitespace (extra/embedded spaces).
	•	space_score – 1 − Space_diff (higher means whitespace is aligned).

Not modeled: raw source_data / destination_data strings are used only to derive the above features and are excluded from feature_columns.

C. Standardizations Applied
	•	Whitespace normalization (trim/collapse) for space metrics.
	•	Case normalization (lower/upper) for case-insensitive measures.
	•	Numeric parsing with tolerant handling for signs, grouping, decimals, and scientific notation to set the binary flags/scores consistently.
	•	Symbol stripping for special-character measures (kept only for score calculation; originals untouched).

D. Treatments Explicitly Not Applied
	•	No row deletions, no outlier capping/winsorization, no imputations, no target/feature scaling, and no class re-balancing. The dataset retains operational edge cases by design.

E. Evidence & QA
	•	Successful float casts and VectorAssembler creation confirm numeric readiness.
	•	Train/test split via randomSplit([0.8, 0.2]) preserves class presence (see saved confusion-matrix Excel and Spark logs for RF / SVM-OVR / LR).
	•	Distributions of key features and class counts are stable across splits; model performance is consistent on holdout.

If you want this converted into a one-page checklist table (Check ▸ Rule ▸ Implementation ▸ Result ▸ Evidence) I can draft that too.
