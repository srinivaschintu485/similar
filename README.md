**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySparkâ€™s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.
Segmentation Scheme
This section outlines whether different segments of data were modeled separately (e.g., based on observation groups like mismatch type, data domain, etc.). In our case, a single model was built across all records without separate modeling per segment.

ðŸ”¹ Segmentation Technique
No explicit segmentation technique was applied in this project. All records (whether matched or mismatched) were treated uniformly under a unified model structure.

However, internally, the dataset included multiple mismatch types (e.g., leading zero, rounding, format mismatch, sign change), but instead of creating separate models per type, a single ensemble classifier (Random Forest, SVM, etc.) was trained across all types. The mismatch type was considered as a categorical feature, not as a segmentation driver.

Thus, segmentation was not used to drive separate modeling equations but was embedded in the feature space to improve model generalization across mismatch classes.

ðŸ”¹ Final Segmentation
As no disjoint segments were modeled independently, the final segmentation also remains unified. The model was trained on the entire dataset with class labels "Mismatch" vs "NoMismatch", ensuring consistent performance across all mismatch types.

ðŸ”¹ Segmentation Stability
Since no explicit segmentation was performed, stability analysis by segment was not applicable. However, model performance was tested uniformly across the entire dataset, including both:

DEV (Development Sample)

OOT (Out-of-Time Sample)

This ensured that the model behavior remained stable and generalizable across different types of mismatches present in the synthetic data.
