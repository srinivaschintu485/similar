High-Level Summary of Findings
Precert ‚Äì AIML is an automated solution that compares structured data from source and target files to identify and explain discrepancies. The system is designed to reduce the manual effort required to investigate data mismatches across enterprise systems. It processes input files in formats such as .xlsx, .csv, and .txt, calculates a similarity index, and predicts the root causes of differences using a machine learning ensemble.

Over 10 predefined discrepancy categories‚Äîincluding case sensitivity, special character variations, numerical precision mismatches, and scientific notation differences‚Äîare considered during analysis. Each record is evaluated using multiple classification models, and the final output includes the top three predicted reasons for mismatch along with confidence scores. These insights are used by Citi Bank teams to improve data quality and reduce manual reconciliation.

Model Framework
The system receives metadata and file references via Kafka, processes the data using Spark, and applies a set of engineered rules and classifiers. Each source‚Äìtarget record pair is passed through an ensemble of three machine learning models‚ÄîRandom Forest, Linear SVM, and Logistic Regression.

When all models agree on a discrepancy label, the system finalizes that prediction. If two models agree and one differs, the majority label is selected as the final disposition. In cases where all three models disagree, the result is escalated for manual review or flagged for further investigation.

Final predictions are exported in Excel format and structured to match the input layout for traceability. This ensures consistent handling across systems and improves downstream processing by business users and data stewards.

üéØ Purpose & Vision
Traditional data comparison is slow, manual, and reactive. This service transforms that process into a smart, explainable, and automated pipeline using Apache Kafka, Spark, and machine learning.

By analyzing structural and semantic differences between datasets, we generate:

A quantified similarity score

Root-cause predictions behind mismatches

Automated feedback loops for continuous learning

The goal: reduce hours of manual review to seconds of actionable insight.

üìò What Problem Are We Solving?
Data inconsistencies often appear across source and target systems ‚Äî but why they occur is rarely obvious.

This system answers the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù ‚Äî not just the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù ‚Äî using ML-driven context-aware predictions.

Result: reduced firefighting, increased trust in reporting pipelines, and faster issue resolution.

Provide actionable insights to address discrepancies

Problem Statement:
Manual comparison of datasets is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks context. This service introduces automation and intelligence, helping users understand why data differences occur ‚Äî not just where.

End Users:
Citi employees across multiple functions rely on the system to interpret and act upon discrepancies in their operational and reporting pipelines.
