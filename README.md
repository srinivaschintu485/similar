**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

. Process: Input & Context

User Input: Natural language question.

Database Schema Input: Provided in DDL (SQL create statements) or JSON format.

Context: Optional user role or business rules.

Requirements:

Parser to normalize schema into machine-readable format.

Storage for schema “cards” (tables, columns, relations).

Tech Stack:

Python 3.11

Libraries: sqlparse or sqlglot for schema parsing.

Storage: JSONL files or a lightweight DB (SQLite, DuckDB).

2. Process: Retrieval (R in RAG)

Goal: Fetch relevant schema pieces based on the natural question.

Requirements:

Embedding model for schema + query.

Vector store for similarity search.

Optional hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense).

Tech Stack:

Embedding: sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

Vector DB: FAISS (fast, local), or alternatives like Weaviate / Pinecone if scaling.

Hybrid retrieval: rank_bm25 (Python).

3. Process: SQL Generation (Generation in RAG)

Goal: Use retrieved schema context + question to generate SQL.

Requirements:

Prompt template combining schema + instructions.

LLM trained/fine-tuned for SQL generation.

Guardrails to enforce read-only SQL.

Tech Stack:

Model:

Lightweight → Salesforce/codet5p-770m-sql

Stronger → defog/sqlcoder-7b

Frameworks: HuggingFace Transformers / vLLM.

Guardrails: sqlglot (parse & enforce SELECT-only, add LIMIT).

4. Process: Post-Processing & Execution

Goal: Validate, normalize, and (optionally) run SQL.

Requirements:

Syntax validation and normalization.

Security layer (block DROP/INSERT/UPDATE).

DB connector for execution.

Tech Stack:

SQL parsing: sqlglot.

DB connectors: psycopg2 (Postgres), pyodbc (SQL Server), duckdb (testing).

Result return: Pandas DataFrame or JSON.

5. Process: API & Service Layer

Goal: Expose the pipeline as an API.

Requirements:

Endpoint /sql to accept {question, schema, execute_flag}.

Return {sql_query, explanation, (optional results)}.

Logging + error handling.

Tech Stack:

Backend: FastAPI (Python).

Testing: Pytest + Postman.

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes/Openshift.

6. Process: Evaluation & Metrics

Goal: Measure quality and improve.

Requirements:

Benchmark dataset (Spider).

Metrics: SQL accuracy, execution accuracy, latency.

Continuous retraining/improvement loop.

Tech Stack:

Dataset: Spider (academic benchmark).

Logging + evaluation framework: custom Python scripts.
