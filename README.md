**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.


| Step               | Task                                           | Tool                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1. Collect Logs    | Pull logs from test executions (Infinity logs) | Logstash, Python       |
| 2. Slice Logs      | Segment logs by error case or test ID          | Custom scripts         |
| 3. Generate Prompt | Dynamically frame a prompt with the log        | LangChain / Python     |
| 4. Send to LLM     | Send prompt to GPT or Claude via API           | OpenAI/Anthropic       |
| 5. Parse Output    | Extract structured info (tag, cause, fix)      | Regex or JSON mode     |
| 6. Display         | Show in UI, Slack bot, or dashboard            | Streamlit, Teams, etc. |


The model operates within the PreCertification (PreCert) framework, which is part of the regulatory data acquisition process for validating inbound data files from CSIs and products across global systems. The framework follows a 3-stage process:

Initial File Validation – Inbound files are compared against production copies to identify structural or formatting differences. Only expected differences are allowed for release, while anomalies are flagged for review.

Difference Remediation – Discrepancies are analyzed by the ML tool, which classifies them into predefined categories (e.g., numeric formatting, special character differences). This enables automated resolution for standard issues and highlights cases requiring human review.

Final Certification – Files are revalidated after remediation. The model ensures clean data submission, providing transparency through confidence scoring and documentation for regulatory reporting.

By embedding AI/ML into this process, PreCert significantly accelerates reconciliation cycles, reduces manual overhead, and strengthens compliance with regulatory standards.
