**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySparkâ€™s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.
Derived Variables
In this modeling exercise, a set of derived variables were constructed to quantify discrepancies between source and target columns across various formatting and content dimensions. These variables are essential in capturing the nature and root causes of mismatches between two fields, especially when controlled variations are introduced. The logic behind each derived variable is explained below:

1. Scientific_Notation_Flag
Indicates whether one of the values is represented in scientific notation (e.g., 1.23E4) while the other is not. Helps detect formatting mismatches in numerical representations.

2. Thousand_Separator_Flag
Checks for the presence or absence of thousand separators (e.g., 1,000 vs. 1000). A mismatch here could indicate locale or formatting-related differences.

3. Rounded_Off_Flag
Flags whether a numerical value appears rounded off (e.g., 9.876 vs. 9.88). The difference is captured either via exact match tolerance or absolute difference below a threshold.

4. Leading_Zero_Flag
Detects if one of the values has extra leading zeros (e.g., 00123 vs. 123). This helps in catching standardization or padding-related transformations.

5. Negative_Check_Flag
Determines whether a sign inversion or missing minus sign exists (e.g., -200 vs. 200), which is critical in financial and metric-driven datasets.

6. Numeric_Check_Score
A composite score that captures how much the numeric parts of two values differ. This is typically calculated via absolute/percentage delta.

7. Case_Sensitive_Score
Compares strings in a case-sensitive manner. Useful when the mismatch is purely due to capitalization differences (e.g., Bank vs. bank).

8. Case_Insensitive_Score
A relaxed version of the above, used to detect deeper differences after normalizing casing.

9. Special_Character_Diff
Flags mismatches caused by the presence or absence of special characters like @, #, -, /, etc. This helps detect parsing or tokenization issues.

10. Space_Diff / Space_Score
Captures extra or missing whitespace (e.g., ABC DEF vs. ABCDEF). The score reflects how many such differences exist and their impact.

11. Source_Length / Destination_Length
Numeric features measuring the string lengths of both source and target values. Can help models infer truncation, padding, or formatting issues.

Each of these derived variables was engineered to provide the model with a granular and interpretable understanding of field-level differences. These features are later used by the classification model to assign a label such as Match or the specific Mismatch Reason based on the patterns learned.
