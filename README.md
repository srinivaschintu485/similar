**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

Purpose. These assumptions describe the business context and operating boundaries under which the PreCert Diff multi-class classifier (Random Forest in prod; SVM/LogReg used during testing) is intended to run so that outputs remain reliable for operations and audit.

A. Scope & Data-Generation

Record-level scope. Model explains record-level mismatches between two structured files (CSV/Excel/TXT) in the Pre-Certification DQ process. It is not designed for file-level bulk transforms or unstructured text.

Stable label taxonomy. The 10 business classes are fixed and operationally meaningful:
{No Match, Negative vs Positive, Thousand Separator Difference, Special Character Differences, Extra Space Issues, Case Sensitivity, Matched, Leading Zero Issue, Scientific Notation Difference, Rounded Off Numbers}.
Any add/remove requires retrain and refreshed documentation.

Synthetic data representativeness. Training used synthetically generated records based on business rules (sign flips, separators, spaces, rounding, leading zeros, scientific notation). We assume these rules faithfully approximate production patterns; this is checked against live samples during monitoring.

Record independence. Row-pairs (source vs target) are treated as conditionally independent once features are engineered; residual batch effects are assumed negligible for classification.

Field/schema stability. Input fields keep consistent semantics (e.g., balance_amount remains numeric with the same business meaning). Breaking schema changes must be announced and validated prior to scoring.

B. Operations & SLA

Throughput/latency. End-to-end scoring fits operational SLAs (minutes per batch) via Kafka/Spark pipelines and automated feature assembly.

Human-in-the-loop. Low-confidence or novel patterns are queued for analyst review; outcomes are logged and fed into the retraining backlog.

Versioning & change control. Model, features, thresholds, and label dictionaries are version-controlled; any threshold change uses a ticket and release note.

C. Data Quality Preconditions

Input conformance. Files must pass DQ gates (types, encodings, delimiter integrity, row counts). Failed gates quarantine the file; the model does not attempt to repair corrupted structure.

Cost of error is asymmetric. Operationally costly classes (e.g., sign, separator, space issues) prioritize recall over precision in routing policies (confidence bands) to avoid missed actionable mismatches.

D. Adoption & Explainability

Record-level explanations suffice. Users require the predicted class plus top contributing feature flags (e.g., sign mismatch present, separator mismatch true). Global model-agnostic explanations are not required for routine audit provided class semantics are clear.

Confidence is for triage. Confidence/probability supports routing into auto-resolve / analyst queue / escalate; not a single hard cutoff.

E. Monitoring Commitments

Incidence mix tracking. Compare production class shares to training baselines monthly; review if any class shifts by >±30% relative.

Feature drift checks. Track PSI and basic stats for key features (e.g., space_diff, Case_Sensitivity_Diff, Thousand_Separator).

Performance sampling. Adjudicate a stratified sample monthly; compute class-wise precision/recall against business thresholds; initiate retrain if breaches persist 2 consecutive cycles.
