**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

Model Purpose

The purpose of this model is to identify and explain nonmaterial mismatches between structured data from source and target systems within enterprise workflows. Traditionally, such mismatches required 4–6 hours of manual review per reconciliation cycle, depending on dataset size and complexity. This manual process slowed down root-cause analysis, created inefficiencies, and prolonged audit preparation cycles. By embedding machine learning, the model reduces manual intervention, accelerates detection, and provides interpretable results with confidence scores—enabling faster resolution and improved transparency in regulatory reporting.

Time Efficiency Statistics

With manual investigation, classifying and resolving mismatches for a typical dataset could take half a working day (4–6 hours), whereas the ML-driven model processes the same volume in under 10 minutes. This dramatic reduction in turnaround time not only improves operational efficiency but also allows analysts to focus on higher-value activities, such as investigating complex edge cases and refining reconciliation strategies.

Model Background

The model has been developed as an in-house solution, trained on Citi-specific data and leveraging domain knowledge of reconciliation and data quality processes. Unlike generic vendor solutions, this model is designed to address Citi’s unique operational workflows by targeting field-level mismatches rather than bulk transformations, ensuring higher precision, faster detection, and greater applicability to enterprise needs.
