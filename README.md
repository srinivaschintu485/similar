**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

Association and Correlation Matrix (Categorical + Numerical)
This visualization combines two statistical relationship metrics:

Squares represent categorical associations such as uncertainty coefficient or correlation ratio, indicating how much a feature provides informative value to the target variable (Label).

Circles represent numerical Pearson correlations between pairs of continuous features (ranging from -1 to 1). The size and color intensity show the strength and direction of the relationship:

Dark blue = Strong positive

Red = Strong negative

Small/pale = Weak correlation

Key Observations
High Informative Features for Label:

Thousand_Separator, Rounded_Off, and Special_Character_Diff show large squares in the first row, indicating they provide significant information for predicting the label (Match/Mismatch).

Strong Positive Numerical Correlations:

Rounded_Off and Leading_Zero (circle size ≈ 0.7)

Special_Character_Score and Special_Character_Diff (almost perfect correlation)

Low Association or Redundancy:

Scientific_Notation and Negative_Check have low associations both numerically and categorically — these may either be sparse or not helpful in model training.

Case_Insensitive_Score and Case_Sensitive_Score again show up as very similar, implying potential redundancy.

Interpretation Strategy:
Prioritize features with large squares in the first row, as they help the model differentiate between match/mismatch classes.

Drop or combine highly correlated features to reduce dimensionality and avoid multicollinearity.

Retain features that are weakly correlated with others but highly informative to the label — these offer orthogonal (non-redundant) information.
