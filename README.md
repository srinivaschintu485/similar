**PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization**

**Overview**

Welcome to the cutting-edge PySpark Multi-Dataset Discrepancy Categorization tool, a pinnacle of data integrity and discrepancy resolution technology. This innovative project leverages the power of Apache Spark to sift through complex, multi-format datasets, pinpointing and classifying a diverse array of discrepancies that can undermine data reliability and accuracy. Our tool explores beyond the surface to address deep-rooted data inconsistencies originating from diverse sources and formats, including CSV and Excel, through a meticulously designed analytical engine.


**Discrepancy Types Addressed:**

**Leading Zero Issues:** Safeguarding numeral integrity by preserving significant zeroes.

**Decimal Precision Differences**: Aligning decimal accuracy across data points.

**Thousands Separator Differences:** Standardizing numerical formatting across locales.

**Scientific Notation Differences:** Ensuring uniform expression of scientific figures.

**Currency Symbol Differences:** Facilitating accurate financial data analysis with threshold validation.

**Rounded Off Numbers:** Addressing variations in rounding practices that impact data interpretation.

**Abbreviation vs. Full Form Differences:** Harmonizing terminological inconsistencies.

**Case Sensitivity Issues:** Rectifying discrepancies arising from text case variations.

**Extra Space Issues:** Cleansing data of superfluous spacing for precision.

**Special Character Differences:** Unifying textual data that includes diverse character sets.

These discrepancies are systematically identified and resolved, ensuring your data remains pristine and reflective of its true value.

**Innovative Features**

**Comprehensive Discrepancy Detection:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to detect and resolve a wide spectrum of data discrepancies.

**Scalable Data Transformation:** Employs PySpark’s robust processing capabilities to manage vast datasets efficiently.

**Multi-format and Multi-sheet Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrates with both CSV and Excel formats, processing multiple sheets within Excel files to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Advanced Currency Handling:** Supports an array of global currency symbols, enhancing the tool's utility for international financial data operations.

**Dual Processing Capabilities:** Equally adept at handling both numeric and textual data discrepancies, providing a versatile solution for diverse data challenges.

| 5. Parse Output    | Extract structured info (tag, cause, fix)      | Regex or JSON mode     |
| 6. Display         | Show in UI, Slack bot, or dashboard            | Streamlit, Teams, etc. |

The development of this model was driven by the increased manual effort and inefficiency in root-cause analysis of data breaks during reconciliations and audit preparation cycles. As data volumes and system complexity grew, traditional rule-based matching approaches became insufficient to handle anomalies, leading to delays, inconsistent explanations, and higher operational costs.

Solution

To address these limitations, a machine learning–based AIML system was proposed. This system automates anomaly detection and provides transparent explanations, significantly reducing manual interventions. The Precert AIML model is specifically trained to operate at the field level, handling both human-entered and system-generated records. Unlike bulk or file-level transformations, it focuses only on row-level, field-to-field mappings across datasets. The solution excludes unstructured inputs and ambiguous mappings, ensuring higher accuracy, scalability, and efficiency in anomaly detection.
