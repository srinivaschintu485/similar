he model is applied to structured datasets exchanged between upstream and downstream systems within enterprise data pipelines. These datasets typically contain financial, operational, or compliance-related information shared across departments or platforms (e.g., ERP to analytics layers, reporting tools, or reconciliation modules). The primary goal is to detect and classify discrepancies at a field level across matched records in source and target datasets.

This system is designed to support Citi teams in proactively identifying mismatches caused by formatting differences, data entry inconsistencies, or transformation errors introduced during ETL or system integration. Examples of such discrepancies include scientific notation mismatches, leading/trailing space issues, special character differences, case sensitivity, or currency format variations.

The key event leading to the development of this model was the increased manual effort and inefficiency in root-cause analysis of data breaks during reconciliations and audit preparation cycles. As data volume and system complexity grew, traditional rule-based matching approaches became insufficient. Therefore, a machine learning-based system was proposed to enhance the automation of anomaly detection and explanation.

The Precert AIML model is specifically trained to operate on records involving human-entered or system-generated data at the field level, not on entire file-level patterns or bulk transformations. The focus population includes only rows with clear field-to-field mapping across two datasets and excludes unstructured inputs or ambiguous mappings.
